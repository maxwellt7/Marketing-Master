# 🚀 NeonChat - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Issues Fixed

The runtime error has been successfully debugged and fixed! The application now runs without errors.

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

The application was crashing with a runtime error due to:
1. **localStorage access during React initialization** - Fixed by adding browser checks
2. **Missing database configuration** - Fixed by adding mock storage fallback
3. **Server configuration incompatibility** - Fixed by updating listen method

## 🏃 How to Run

### Development Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The server will start on port 5000 by default, or you can specify a different port:
```bash
PORT=3000 npm run dev
```

### Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

Or if using default port:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 💡 Tips

### Development
- The app works WITHOUT a database in development mode
- Uses in-memory storage for sessions/messages
- Data resets when server restarts (expected behavior)

### Production
To use persistent storage in production:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
npm run db:push  # Create database tables
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🔥 Current Status

**🟢 FULLY OPERATIONAL**
